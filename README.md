# release-example-for-deploy
This is example repository to demonstrate release branch workflow

Used to demonstrate workflow of https://github.com/janson-git/deploy

It contains some example text that will change in other `feature-branches`

Let's check how it works!

example_branch_3 just add the text. I hope it happened without conflicts.
